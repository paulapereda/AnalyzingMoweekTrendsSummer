# Data but make it fashion 

This repository contains the project "Data but make it fashion," which was chosen by a LatinR academic committee to be presented at the conference. LatinR is the Latin American Conference on the Use of R in Research + Development.

"Data but make it fashion" is a personal project about web-scraping data and images from Moweek (Uruguay's Fashion Week). 
The goal? To analyze trends using models and data analysis tools. K-means clustering was applied to images to obtain trend colors, size analysis, and national and sustainable production.
